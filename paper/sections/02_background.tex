\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Rosenbrock Methods for Stiff Systems}
Rosenbrock and Rosenbrock-W methods avoid full nonlinear solves by linearizing stage equations around the current state, while retaining stiff stability properties \citep{kaps1979,hairerwanner1996}. This makes them attractive for large chemistry systems with sparse Jacobians.

\subsection{DAE Foundations}
For index-1 systems, a common formulation is
\begin{equation}
  M\,\dot{c} = \widetilde{F}(c, t),
\end{equation}
with singular rows for algebraic variables. A partitioned block form uses $u=[x;y]^{\mathsf{T}}$ with differential and algebraic components. Runge-Kutta and Rosenbrock treatments for DAEs are discussed in classic references \citep{hairerlubichroche1989,roche1988,hairerwanner1996}.

\subsection{Atmospheric Chemistry Solver Benchmarks}
Comparative atmospheric chemistry studies from the Sandu benchmark series remain a useful baseline for accuracy-cost analysis \citep{sandu1997implicit}. The Rosenbrock-focused extension in \citet{sandu1997rosenbrock} is directly relevant for this paper. Recent work has also revisited Rosenbrock step-size control behavior in chemistry mechanisms \citep{liao2025}.
