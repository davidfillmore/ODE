\section{Verification and Test Evidence}
\label{sec:verification}

Current MICM tests cover constraint residual assembly for $g(c)$, Jacobian row replacement in $J$, reordered-state execution, stiff coupling, and selected conservation checks for equilibrium constraints.

\subsection{Existing Coverage}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Unit tests for `ConstraintSet` API and sparsity behavior.
  \item Unit tests for Rosenbrock error normalization with constrained ($M_{ii}=0$) rows excluded as intended.
  \item Integration tests for multi-stage DAE parameter sets and coupled constraints.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Known Gaps}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item No canonical Robertson-style DAE benchmark in the current suite.
  \item No temperature-dependent $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$ validation path.
  \item No higher-index DAE coverage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planned Additions for This Paper}
Benchmark additions are aligned with atmospheric chemistry precedent \citep{sandu1997implicit,sandu1997rosenbrock} and modern Rosenbrock controller analysis \citep{liao2025}. We will report both state error metrics (for $c$) and algebraic residual metrics (for $g(c)$).
