\subsection{Strengths of Current MICM Design}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Species-sized state with explicit algebraic-row masking keeps data layout straightforward.
  \item Row-replacement constraints integrate naturally with sparse Rosenbrock assembly.
  \item Existing test coverage already exercises several difficult corner cases.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Current Limitations}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Constraint coverage is currently limited to equilibrium constraints.
  \item Static equilibrium constants limit physical fidelity for temperature-varying studies.
  \item Assumptions are targeted to index-1 behavior.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications for Atmospheric Modeling}
This section will connect implementation findings to production chemistry integration decisions in larger Earth-system workflows \citep{pfister2024micm}.
