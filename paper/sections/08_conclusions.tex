\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This scaffold will conclude with:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item the validated behavior of MICM's Rosenbrock DAE implementation for $M\dot{c}=\widetilde{F}(c)$ with algebraic constraints $g(c)=0$,
  \item observed tradeoffs across parameter sets and benchmark classes, and
  \item a prioritized roadmap for constraints, benchmarking, and reproducibility.
\end{enumerate}
